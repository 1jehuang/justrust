# Full Rust implementation tracker

The requested outcome is full Rust support, not completion of a sequence of toy
subsets. This checklist stays open until compatibility evidence supports closing
it. `RUST-COMPATIBILITY.md` defines the contract and dependency ordering.

## Completed foundations, not full compatibility

- [x] Independent graph runtime with shared immutable facts and lifecycle telemetry.
- [x] Direct native Linux x86-64 executable generation for the initial subset.
- [x] Inline modules, qualified calls, simple imports and namespace/privacy checks.
- [x] External module source trees with bounded loading and observed source facts.
- [x] Scalar checked-function IR shared directly by checking and native emission.
- [x] Hosted acceptance, stock differential cases and qualified benchmark receipts.

## Remaining implementation program

- [ ] Source organization: external modules, source maps, grouped/glob imports,
      reexports, restricted visibility, item identities and edition behavior.
- [ ] Typed IR and data: all numeric primitives/literals, tuples, arrays, slices,
      structs/enums, layouts, construction, projections, casts and coercions.
- [ ] Patterns and control flow: destructuring, exhaustiveness, match, loop,
      break/continue, labels, diverging expressions and correct expression typing.
- [ ] Ownership: places, initialization/moves, references, loans, lifetimes,
      borrow/drop checking and destruction.
- [ ] Abstraction: generics, inference, traits, impls/methods, associated items,
      coherence, trait objects and monomorphization.
- [ ] Closures, capture semantics, iterators, async/await and coroutine lowering.
- [ ] Compile-time work: const evaluation/generics, statics, attributes/cfg,
      declarative macro hygiene and procedural macros.
- [ ] Runtime/platform: ABI/FFI, linking, unsafe operations, allocation, intrinsics,
      atomics, TLS, unwinding, debug information and additional targets.
- [ ] Libraries: compile core/alloc/std and external dependencies on the native
      implementation path without delegating compilation to stock tools.
- [ ] Existing projects: manifests, dependency resolution, features, build scripts,
      native libraries, proc-macro integration and test/bench harnesses.
- [ ] Integrated graph: finer source/semantic operations, cache keys, cross-build
      reuse, secure multitenant reuse, resource-aware scheduling and observability.
- [ ] Conformance: pinned positive/negative differential suites, minimized
      soundness/wrong-code regressions, diagnostic tests and real-project gates.
- [ ] Performance: representative debug/release/cold/edit workloads, scaling and
      contention measurements, without equating subset timings with full Rust.
- [ ] Completion: validate the explicit edition/version/target contract, standard
      libraries, real projects and self-hosting. Self-hosting alone is not enough.

## Active slice

Unlabelled loop expressions, break values, continue, while-loop exits and correct
semicolon-discard typing. Resolve loop target IDs in checked functions and restore
exact temporary-stack depth on native control transfers. Preserve invalid-program
checking, explicit unsupported boundaries and existing graph reuse. Labels, for
loops and general while expressions remain following work, not silently accepted.

External source loading and scalar typed IR are completed prerequisite slices,
not completion of source organization, general types, ownership or full Rust.

No checkbox for an entire category is closed by implementing one slice. Unsupported
legal programs remain tracked as gaps, never counted as conformance successes.
