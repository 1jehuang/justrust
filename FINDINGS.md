# Findings: where agent build time goes

Data: `~/.jcode/sessions` on one developer machine (16-thread Core Ultra X9,
62 GiB). Covers Jcode and Jcode Desktop work from late August to early October
2026. Collected with `justrust history`. "Foreground" means the agent was
blocked waiting on the tool call. Calls over 30 minutes (hung processes) are
excluded.

## Headline numbers

| Repo                     | Foreground cargo calls | Agent-blocked time | p50   | p90    |
|--------------------------|-----------------------:|-------------------:|------:|-------:|
| Jcode + Jcode Desktop    | 3,470                  | 52.3 h             | 16 s  | 134 s  |
| Jcode Desktop only       | 2,557                  | 41.1 h             | 18 s  | 148 s  |

By kind (Desktop): test 27.7 h, build 8.7 h, check 4.7 h, fmt 0.1 h.

## 1. Test calls are 90% compile, 10% tests

For test calls whose output included libtest results:

- Wall time: 21.0 h
- Actually executing tests: 2.1 h (10%)
- Compiling, linking, and overhead: 18.9 h (90%)
- Median tests run per call: about 20 (p90 about 1,400)

Agents typically ask for about 20 tests and pay for rebuilding and relinking
the whole test binary to get them.

## 2. One crate dominates

`cargo test -p jcode-desktop-ui [--lib]` alone accounts for 18 h, almost half
of all Desktop wait time. `jcode-desktop-ui` has 143k lines and 941 `#[test]`s
in one crate. Its debug test binary is about 670 MB.

Measured a controlled single-line edit in `fps_counter.rs`, using
`cargo test -p jcode-desktop-ui --lib --no-run` with mold and the parallel
frontend already enabled:

| Scenario                           | Wall   |
|------------------------------------|-------:|
| No-op (nothing changed)            | 0.5 s  |
| Body edit (first, upstream dirty)  | 32.3 s (jcode-base 10.1 s + desktop-ui 21.7 s) |
| Edit adding an item                | 9.9 s  |
| Revert edit                        | 9.5 s  |

So a best-case one-line change in this crate costs about 9 to 10 s. The
historical p50 is 24 s and p90 is 163 s, meaning most real calls pay well
beyond that best case: upstream crates rebuilding, cold incremental caches,
flag or target-dir changes, and lock waits.

## 3. A fifth of the time ends in a compile error

581 foreground calls (11.7 h, 22%) ended with `error:` output. Those calls
waited on full test or build pipelines just to learn about a type error that
`cargo check` (or a warm rust-analyzer) could have reported sooner.

## 4. Smaller effects

- Cargo lock contention: 107 calls, 0.8 h. Parallel agents in the same
  checkout serialize on `target/`.
- 1,300 background cargo calls are not counted above. They still use CPU and
  the cargo lock, which slows down foreground calls.
- `target/` in Jcode Desktop is 466 GB.
- Test execution is rarely the bottleneck: p50 0.5 s, p90 about 20 s per call.

## Implications for justrust

1. Optimize compile and link for test binaries, not test execution.
2. Answer with check-speed diagnostics first. Only build test binaries once
   the code type-checks.
3. Huge single-crate test binaries are the main cost center. Build and link
   only what the requested tests need, or keep the test binary hot-patchable.
4. Keep incremental state warm and isolated per agent so calls hit the 10 s
   best case, or better, instead of the 24 s median.
