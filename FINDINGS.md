# Findings: where agent build time goes

Data: `~/.jcode/sessions` on one developer machine (16-thread Core Ultra X9,
62 GiB). Covers Jcode and Jcode Desktop work from late August to early October
2026. Collected with `justrust history`. "Foreground" means the agent was
blocked waiting on the tool call. Calls over 30 minutes (hung processes) are
excluded.

## Headline numbers

| Repo                     | Foreground cargo calls | Agent-blocked time | p50   | p90    |
|--------------------------|-----------------------:|-------------------:|------:|-------:|
| Jcode + Jcode Desktop    | 3,470                  | 52.3 h             | 16 s  | 134 s  |
| Jcode Desktop only       | 2,557                  | 41.1 h             | 18 s  | 148 s  |

By kind (Desktop): test 27.7 h, build 8.7 h, check 4.7 h, fmt 0.1 h.

## 1. Test calls are 90% compile, 10% tests

For test calls whose output included libtest results:

- Wall time: 21.0 h
- Actually executing tests: 2.1 h (10%)
- Compiling, linking, and overhead: 18.9 h (90%)
- Median tests run per call: about 20 (p90 about 1,400)

Agents typically ask for about 20 tests and pay for rebuilding and relinking
the whole test binary to get them.

## 2. One crate dominates

`cargo test -p jcode-desktop-ui [--lib]` alone accounts for 18 h, almost half
of all Desktop wait time. `jcode-desktop-ui` has 143k lines and 941 `#[test]`s
in one crate. Its debug test binary is about 670 MB.

Measured a controlled single-line edit in `fps_counter.rs`, using
`cargo test -p jcode-desktop-ui --lib --no-run` with mold and the parallel
frontend already enabled:

| Scenario                           | Wall   |
|------------------------------------|-------:|
| No-op (nothing changed)            | 0.5 s  |
| Body edit (first, upstream dirty)  | 32.3 s (jcode-base 10.1 s + desktop-ui 21.7 s) |
| Edit adding an item                | 9.9 s  |
| Revert edit                        | 9.5 s  |

So a best-case one-line change in this crate costs about 9 to 10 s. The
historical p50 is 24 s and p90 is 163 s, meaning most real calls pay well
beyond that best case: upstream crates rebuilding, cold incremental caches,
flag or target-dir changes, and lock waits.

## 3. A fifth of the time ends in a compile error

581 foreground calls (11.7 h, 22%) ended with `error:` output. Those calls
waited on full test or build pipelines just to learn about a type error that
`cargo check` (or a warm rust-analyzer) could have reported sooner.

## 4. Smaller effects

- Cargo lock contention: 107 calls, 0.8 h. Parallel agents in the same
  checkout serialize on `target/`.
- 1,300 background cargo calls are not counted above. They still use CPU and
  the cargo lock, which slows down foreground calls.
- `target/` in Jcode Desktop is 466 GB.
- Test execution is rarely the bottleneck: p50 0.5 s, p90 about 20 s per call.

## 5. Observed: a dependency edit forces a full rebuild of the downstream crate

Run `20261007-214608994-2456373`. A one-line test-body edit in
`jcode-desktop-ui` took **46.3s**, against 9.5s for the same edit earlier.
`jcode_base` (a path dependency in `~/jcode`, edited by another agent at the
same time) had changed and rebuilt in 10.5s. Because its metadata changed,
`jcode_desktop_ui (test)` reused no codegen units: `codegen_crate` took 23.6s,
monomorphization 9.4s, and LLVM 11.9s, using 118s of CPU.

Implication: parallel agents editing shared upstream crates turn cheap
incremental builds into near-full rebuilds for everyone downstream. Candidates
are isolated per-agent build dirs pinned to a stable upstream snapshot, and
sharing or avoiding codegen when only an upstream body (not its API) changed.

## Implications for justrust

1. Optimize compile and link for test binaries, not test execution.
2. Answer with check-speed diagnostics first. Only build test binaries once
   the code type-checks.
3. Huge single-crate test binaries are the main cost center. Build and link
   only what the requested tests need, or keep the test binary hot-patchable.
4. Keep incremental state warm and isolated per agent so calls hit the 10 s
   best case, or better, instead of the 24 s median.

## 6. Jcode Desktop compiles gpui twice: build vs test (gpui `test-support`)

Measured 2026-10-07 on a scratch copy of `~/jcode-desktop` (HEAD 9a92572,
separate `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`s under `~/.jcode/scratch/gpuifeat`). Benchmark:
delete the `gpui-*` fingerprint dirs (forces gpui and its dependents to
rebuild), then `justrust build -p jcode-desktop -p jcode-desktop-ui --lib`
followed by `justrust test -p jcode-desktop-ui --lib -- fps_counter`.

Cause: both Desktop manifests enable gpui's `test-support` only under
`[dev-dependencies]`. With resolver 2 the test unit graph turns on
`test-support` (= `leak-detection` + `backtrace` + `proptest` +
`collections/test-support` + `http_client/test-support`). Unit graph diff
(`cargo build/test --unit-graph -Z unstable-options`, comparing units by
features, profile and transitive deps): build 950 units, test 959, 927 shared,
32 test-only. The expensive test-only ones are gpui, gpui_linux, gpui_wgpu,
gpui_platform, gpui_thinking_orbs, sum_tree, zlog, ztracing, plus
jcode_sdk/jcode_desktop_api/jcode_desktop_ui and proptest's deps. A second
split comes from the `hdrhistogram = "7.6"` dev-dep (default features
`serialization`, `sync`) versus gpui's `default-features = false` one.

| run | build | test | gpui-family units (build+test) |
|---|---|---|---|
| before1 | 53.3s | 61.5s | 3+3 |
| before2 | 73.3s | 103.9s | 3+3 |
| before3 | 93.0s | 97.5s | 3+3 |
| after1 | 72.8s | 10.9s | 3+0 |
| after2 | 85.3s | 25.0s | 3+0 |
| after3 | 89.3s | 13.7s | 3+0 |

"after" = gpui `test-support` in normal `[dependencies]` of both crates and
`hdrhistogram` dev-dep with `default-features = false`. The unit graph then
differs only in the jcode_desktop_ui test unit itself. Medians: before
73.3s + 97.5s = 170.8s, after 85.3s + 13.7s = 99.0s, about 72s (42%) saved
per gpui-invalidating build+test cycle. The test step drops from about 98s to
about 14s. The machine was shared (other agents compiling), so absolute
times are noisy (build 53-93s for the same work). The test-step drop is far
larger than the noise. Run ids: before1 20261007-223529986-2792438 /
20261007-223623262-2799898, before2 20261007-224549993-2900285 /

Not applied, because no option was safe:

- Enabling `test-support` in `[dependencies]` also enables it for release and
  shipped builds. `[target.'cfg(debug_assertions)'.dependencies]` does not help.
  Cargo evaluates target cfgs against the target platform, not the profile, so
  the unit graph of `cargo build --release` still had `test-support` (checked).
- It changes runtime behavior of the dev app (Ctrl+R hot reload and the
  running Desktop use dev builds): `leak-detection` takes the
  `EntityRefCounts` write lock and inserts into a HashMap on every
  `Entity`/`AnyEntity` creation, clone and drop, and `LeakDetector::drop`
  panics with "Exited with leaked handles" if any entity handle is alive when
  the App is torn down. It also adds `debug_bounds` and `debug_selector`
  bookkeeping each frame (Desktop uses `debug_selector` in about ten places),
  the test scheduler branch in `ForegroundExecutor::new`, and turns off the
  profiler's foreground runnable counter only for test dispatchers.
- Making tests drop `test-support` is not possible. 134 Desktop test files use
  `#[gpui::test]`, `TestAppContext`, `run_until_parked` and `add_window_view`,
  which only exist with that feature.
- A Desktop cargo feature (say `dev-tools = ["gpui/test-support"]`) that Ctrl+R,
  the launcher and agents always pass would unify the graphs, but every build
  path (rust-analyzer, `desktop_selfdev`, scripts, CI) must agree or it
  reintroduces the split and an ABI split between host and plugin. Ctrl+R
  builds `-p jcode-desktop -p jcode-desktop-ui` so the host and plugin share
  one GPUI feature set. It also carries the same behavior change above.

The safe part on its own: the `hdrhistogram` dev-dep with
`default-features = false` only removes the hdrhistogram/crossbeam_channel
test-only units (small, under 1s). It is not worth a separate change because
the gpui split dominates.

Possible real fixes, all upstream in the gpui fork (github.com/1jehuang/gpui):
split `test-support` so the test APIs (`TestAppContext`, `gpui::test`,
`TestPlatform`) compile always (or behind a no-runtime-effect feature),
while `leak-detection` stays opt-in. Or make leak detection a runtime toggle.
Then Desktop could enable the API-only feature in `[dependencies]` with no
runtime change and the 32-unit split disappears. For justrust: a finding
that detects "the same package compiled with different feature sets in check,
build and test" (dev-dependency feature unification) and names the
dev-dependency causing it would have found this immediately.
